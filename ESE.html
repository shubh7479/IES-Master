                    IES is among the most prestigious and coveted career options that are available for engineers
                    encompassing private, public and government sectors. Just like the Civil Services, the candidates
                    recruited for the IES are highly honored by the government and the society.
                    <br>
                    Since there are many opportunities for engineers in the public sector like Indian Railways, Central
                    Engineering, Military Engineering, Telecommunications, Central Water Services and many other
                    departments, the IES is a highly desired job where candidates get to play an important role in the
                    development of the country.

                    targets. A thorough knowledge of the subject including clarity of basic concepts along with
                    awareness about current affairs, general knowledge add to the advantages of hard work. A smart and
                    mature persona is also a prerequisite for successfully cracking this exam.

                </h5>
                <h5 class="mt-10">
                    Time management is a very crucial factor during preparation and even writing this exam. One must
                    chalk out a proper strategy and time table. Each subject from the technical section must be devoted
                    at least 3 hours daily to get best results. English and General Studies should also be given 1 hour
                    each so that you can get a cutting edge in exam.

                <h5 class="mt-10">
                    Short notes are very helpful especially in technical subjects. Make short notes of important topics
                    and also a list of formulae and revise them daily.
                </h5>
                <h5 class="mt-10">

                    There are 120 questions in Objective Paper I, evenly based on General Studies and English. Since
                    Comprehension and questions based on rearrangement of sentences are time consuming, candidates can
                    solve those after completing the rest of the exam.

                </h5>
                <h5 class="mt-10">
                    Ensure that you read the Comprehension thoroughly before attempting the questions. This will give

                </h5>
                <h5 class="mt-10">
                    Attempt the questions you find easy before moving on to the difficult ones.

                </h5>
                <h5 class="mt-10">
                    Technical theory questions are best attempted before the numerical since you may take long to
                    attempt
                    numerical which also carry negative marking, so a well attempted theory gives you stronger chance of
                    scoring well and covering up for negative marks

                </h5>
                <h5 class="mt-10">
                    Remember to write the formula in the numerical problems, along with S.I units of quantities involved
                    and also specify the answer.

                </h5>
                <h5 class="mt-10">
                    There are two conventional papers on the third day. Attempt the easy questions first after reading
                    the paper thoroughly and keep the difficult ones for the end.

                </h5>
                <h5 class="mt-10">

                    weightage of each section to streamline your studying strategy. Use Previous year question papers as
                    guide to make smart decisions regarding your study plan.

                </h5>
                <h5 class="mt-10">

                    You can practice previous year question papers to analyze your weak areas. Identify the weak topics
                    and revise them thoroughly. Time yourself as you solve the papers to get an idea of your speed so
                    that you can focus on that too.

                                            Negative marking is there in ESE Prelims stage papers only. The questions
                                            asked in ESE Prelims papers are objective type. In ESE Prelims papers, there
                                            are four options for the answers to every question. For each question for
                                            which a wrong answer has been given by the candidate, one‐third (1/3rd) of
                                            the marks assigned to that question will be deducted as penalty.

                                            If a candidate gives more than one answer, it will be treated as a wrong
                                            answer even if one of the given answers happen to be correct, and in this
                                            case also negative marking is applicable.

                                            If a question is not attempted by the candidate then there would not be any
                                            penalty.

                                            ESE consists of three stages – ESE Prelims, ESE Main, and Personality Test.
                                            All the three stages take almost the entire year. Whereas GATE is a one-day
                                            exam of three hours. Secondly, the syllabus of ESE is very vast, completing
                                            almost the entire engineering syllabus. GATE syllabus includes only those
                                            subjects that are important from higher studies point of view.

                                            Also, the objective of GATE is to test a candidate’s conceptual clarity,
                                            problem-solving skills and in-depth knowledge, ESE on other hand is more of
                                            a speed test and it tests a candidate’s ability to cover the entire syllabus
                                            of General Studies and Engineering.

                                            The syllabus of GATE and ESE is almost similar. The only difference between
                                            these two exams is how a candidate approaches the exams. To crack GATE,
                                            which includes objective type questions, a candidate should have perfect
                                            conceptual clarity and understanding of subjects, and should know short
                                            tricks to deduce the correct answer from the given options. In the case of
                                            ESE, which includes subjective type questions in the Mains stage, a
                                            candidate should have good answer writing skills as well as speed and
                                            accuracy in solving numerical problems.

                                            medical requirements for various posts, and also go through other important
                                            details. Evaluate how much time you have in your hands to prepare for the
                                            exam, do a self-analysis of your strengths and weaknesses by browsing
                                            through previous years question papers, etc. Once done, decide whether you
                                            need ESE coaching, research about the best ESE coaching, watch the videos of
